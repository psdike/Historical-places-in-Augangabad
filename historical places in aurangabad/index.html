<center><h6>Bibi Ka Maqbara (Urdu: بیبی كا مقبرہ‎ "Tomb of the Lady")</h6></center>
<br />
<center>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a maqbara located in Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India. It was commissioned by the sixth Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in the late 17th century in the memory of his first wife, Dilras Banu Begum (posthumously known as Rabia-ud-Daurani).It bears a striking resemblance to the famous Taj Mahal, the mausoleum of his mother, Mumtaz Mahal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aurangzeb was not much interested in architecture, though he had built the small, but elegant, Pearl Mosque at Delhi. The Bibi Ka Maqbara was the largest structure that he had to his credit.The comparison to the Taj Mahal has often obsecured its very own considerable charm.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to its strong resemblance to the Taj Mahal, it is also called the Dakkhani Taj (Taj of the Deccan). Bibi Ka Maqbara is the principal monument of Aurangabad and its historic city.An inscription found on the main entrance door mentions that this mausoleum was designed and erected by Ata-ullah, an architect and Hanspat Rai, an engineer respectively.[4] Ata-ullah was the son of Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, the principal designer of the Taj Mahal.

								<h2>The Ajanta Caves</h2>

<center><h5>The Ajanta Caves (Ajiṇṭhā leni Marathi: अजिंठा लेणी)</h5></center>
<br />
<center>
<p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Aurangabad district of Maharashtra, India are about 300 rock-cut Buddhist cave monuments which date from the 2nd century BCE to about 480 or 650 CE. The caves include paintings and sculptures described by the government Archaeological Survey of India as "the finest surviving examples of Indian art, particularly painting",which are masterpieces of Buddhist religious art, with figures of the Buddha and depictions of the Jataka tales.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caves were built in two phases starting around the 2nd century BCE, with the second group of caves built around 400–650 CE according to older accounts, or all in a brief period between 460 to 480 according to the recent proposals of Walter M. Spink. The Ajanta caves are cut into the side of a cliff that is on the south side of a U-shaped gorge on the small river Waghora (or Wagura), and although they are now along and above a modern pathway running across the cliff they were originally reached by individual stairs or ladders from the side of the river 35 to 110 feet below.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The caves are numbered 1 to 28 according to their place along the path, beginning at the entrance. Further round the gorge are a number of waterfalls, which when the river is high are audible from outside the caves.The caves form the largest corpus of early Indian wall-painting; other survivals from the area of modern India are very few, though they are related to 5th-century paintings at Sigiriya in Sri Lanka.The elaborate architectural carving in many caves is also very rare, and the style of the many figure sculptures is highly local, found only at a few nearby contemporary sites, although the Ajanta tradition can be related to the later Hindu Ellora Caves and other sites.

<center><h5>The Devagiri Fort (देवगिरी किल्ला)</h5></center>
<br />
<center>
<p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daulatabad is a 14th-century fort city in Maharashtra, India, about 16 kilometers northwest of Aurangabad. The place, was once as known as Deogiri,circa the sixth century AD, when it was an important uplands city along caravan routes and is now but a village, based around the former city of the same name. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting 1327, it famously remained the capital of Tughlaq dynasty, under Muhammad bin Tughluq (r. 1325-1351), who also changed its name, and forcibily moved the entire population of Delhi here, for two years, before it was abandoned due to lack of water. There is a tradition that Deoghur or Doulatabad was built in 1203 AD by a Dhangar or herdsman who acquiring by some unusual good fortune vast wealth was named by his brother shepherds Rajah Ram and soon after assumed the rank of a Rajah.
